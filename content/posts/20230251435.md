Official docs:
* [replace directive](https://go.dev/ref/mod#go-mod-file-replace)

The changes are applied in the `go.mod` file.

When using a Github repo or other similar, the version has to be informed:
```
replace github.com/author/repo v1.2.3 => github.com/otherauthor/repo master
```

It also works pointing locally (the version is not required):
```
replace github.com/author/repo v1.2.3 => /path/to/package
```
